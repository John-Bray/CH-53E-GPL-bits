### How to make it work in XP

Start with this very old XP version for the flight-model

which was done by petersphilo in 2006-07, after which he appears to have given up on it. If you open it in an XP9 demo Planemaker and re-save it it's nearly good to go for XP10. **BUT** you will also need to open each .afl in the airfoils folder and re-save them with the **XP9** Airfoil-Maker app.

Repeat this process to get an XP10 version or even one for XP11.

Add the enclosed .obj files, and corresponding textures.

1. The objects will need to be added using PlaneMaker.
1. They will need to be added in the correct sequence.
1. With the correct settings for things like lighting. 

This is not for the faint-hearted / inexperienced user!

**NOTE:** this is still a work in progress!
