which was done by petersphilo in 2006-07 when he appears to have given up on it. If you open it in an XP9 demo Planemaker and re-save it it's nearly good to go for XP10. **BUT** you will also need to open each .afl in the airfoils folder and re-save them with the XP9 Airfoil-Maker app.

Repeat this process to get an XP10 version or one for XP11.

The objects will need to be added using PlaneMaker.  See file MiscObjects.jpg in the download.

**NOTE:** this is still a work in progress!
